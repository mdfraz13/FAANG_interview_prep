# FAANG_interview_prep
Interview prep materials sent me by FAANG companies


 See all software interview prep materials FAANG companies have sent me. Google + Facebook just emailed me again to interview. The last 8 years, 100+ Amazon recruiters + recruiters from all FAANG companies have called me.

Since it takes months to prep for FAANG interviews, + since I get hired quickly, I've never fully gone through a FAANG interview process, except at Google.

My job searches last 1 week to 2 months. I get hired after only applying to 10-20 companies. I research companies carefully first to ensure we're a good match. Don't do the "send resumes to hundreds of companies" bullshit!

See my article "Don't spam companies with resumes": http://bit.ly/2WGVZnX. Be picky. Only apply if you feel you REALISTICALLY have a 50% chance to get hired. Do you feel you're better than 200 others applying for that job? If not, stop applying for software jobs! It's ok. Keep studying.

Google kindly let me skip their technical phone interview + move directly to their final onsite interview.

My 2020 Google interview schedule. I had five 45-minute interviews, with 1 hour lunch:

10:00am - 10:45am PST: Behavioral
10:45am - 11:30am PST: Coding/algorithms
11:30am - 12:15pm PST: Coding/algorithms
Lunch
1:15pm - 2:15pm PST: System design
2:30pm - 3:15pm PST: Coding/algorithms

They rejected me. Google's recruiter spent 30 minutes giving me phone feedback. She said I did well on the behavior interview, could be faster/smoother on my algorithms + system design interviews, + definitely showed all qualities of "Googleyness" (culture fit) they want: https://lnkd.in/gaQ-Q7E4. She invited me to reapply in 9 months(?) + said I can again skip their phone interview, moving directly to their onsite. I haven't yet done another interview with them. Google took really good care of me their whole process!

I attach Facebook's Technical Screen Interview Guide below, since it's very comprehensive.
